This project made for my school exam. Goal is, to evaluate the chlorella algae as a possibiliy for world wide carbon capture. The usage of these algeas in technological optimazed ambients could appear as an attractive method to slow down the climate change.
To achieve an accurate evaluation, the goal of this project is to train an artificial intelligence (AI).

The general AI takes 3 different ambient conditions of the clorella algae into account to calculate a specific carbon capture capacity.
The used ambient conditions are:

1.  The Ambient temperature (in Grad Celsius)
2.  The CO2-proportion of the air (in abs numbers between 0 and 1)
3.  The light intensity ( in LUX)

The outcome:
-> The CO2-capture capacity (in abs numbers between 0 and 1)

The data which is used is not avaiable, but there is the possibility to generate the data due to algorithms. The profound data is coming from:

Prof. Dr. Dr. Haim Trebes (Max Plank institute of algae research)
